Diabetes Prediction AI

It's a project a that uses a machine learning model (logistic regression) which is a classificiation model, shows the likelihood of a person having diabetes.

How it works:
It's trained using a real dataset that's been studied by indian doctors
The data is firstly cleaned and loaded before being tested
After training the model can predict precisely based on the given accuracy

Required Libarires:
Pandas
scikit-learn
numpy
and Python to program

Usage:
Run the script in python
Make the model train the data and give an evaluation
then you can test with new data to get a risk percentage

Output:
Model Accuracy
Diabetes risk prediction
